Compare them based on distance score (create that distance score)
 (they might not be the same amount of segmentation points
   compare with the one that is the closest)

Fuer den besten according to distance score:
 Create confusion matrix
  (compare with the closest one as well)

Have a way to visualize a segmentation result in Python so that both
the found (actual) segmentation points are visualized as well as the
manuel ones.
