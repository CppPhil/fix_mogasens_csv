Figure out a way to export the actual segmentation points found from
Python

Import the actual segmentation points found that were exported from
Python

Compare them based on distance score (create that distance score)
 (they might not be the same amount of segmentation points
  compare with the one that is the closest)

Create confusion matrix
 (compare with the closest one as well)

Have a way to visualize a segmentation result in Python so that both
the found (actual) segmentation points are visualized as well as the
manuel ones.
